## Clustering (Task 1)
Cluster the top 50 words and the reverse of each of those top 50 words, *e.g., half of the occurrences of "canon'' will be transformed into "nonac"*, in order to test clustering accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- Python & Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK, scikit-learn, and NumPy

### Achievements
- Clustering Accuracy of 65%-70%
- Mark 10/13

*For more information see the coursework2-report.pdf section Task 1 (on GitHub)

## Classifying
Using the prelabelled corpus build and train a neural network model to classify positive and negative reviews. I created a bi-directional LSTM model to solve the task.

### Technologies Used
- Python & Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK, tenserflow, and NumPy

### Achievements
- Accuracy of 73.4% with a low standard deviation of 0.017
- Mark 12/12

*For more information see the coursework2-report.pdf section Task 2 (on GitHub)
