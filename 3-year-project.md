# An Object Detection and Tracking System for Drone Navigation (WIP)
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-3rd--year--project-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Mozzer2310/3rd-year-project)

Automatic object tracking and following using a RYZE Tello drone, and OpenCV in C++.

This project was done as my 3rd year project for university, contributing 40 credits for my 3rd year
grade. It was assessed via a video demonstration, report, and short interview.

## Summary
- Creating embedded software, to run on a drone, that allows it to follow and film a specified object. For use in vlogging, cinematography, etc.
- Detect a specified object through **Object Detection**, using **OpenCV**.
- Test, evaluate, and improve the system with real world live tests. Describe the development process and evaluate the system in a project report and showcase video

## Developed Using
- CTello - Available at: https://github.com/carlospzlz/ctello
- CMake (Developed using CMake 3.25)
- OpenCV (Developed using OpenCV 4.6 with opencv_contrib installed)
- Visual Studio
